This project is a blog application developed using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MySQL for the database. The application allows users to view posts, create posts, and interact with other users' posts. It incorporates various features such as user authentication, authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and secure communication with the backend using Axios. Additionally, it utilizes React Router DOM for navigation, hooks for state management, and external libraries like Moment.js for date handling and ReactQuill for rich text editing.
